## CoCCoE test

The [Bechdel Test](https://bechdeltest.com) is a simple test for movies to check for treatment of women. It is simply: 

1. It has to have at least two [named] women in it
2. Who talk to each other
3. About something besides a man

This appeal of this test is its simplicity. Of course, one can identify many ways this is an oversimplification, but as a shorthand for treatment of women, it can be very illuminating.

I propose a similar test for scientific societies: the **CoCCoE** [pronounced "cocoa"] test:

1. Is there a Code of Conduct that can result in expulsion from the meeting for harassment of an attendee?
2. Is there a Code of Ethics that can result in removal from the society for harassment of a member?

Like the Bechdel test, this also seems obvious -- can there really be a society that would let someone, say, convicted of sexual assault show up at a meeting? But when you look into it, there are several. 

As with the Bechdel test, what one does with the test result is a matter of personal choice. Join a society to change this, boycott a society until fixed, ignore completely?
